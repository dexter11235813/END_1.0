Model1 :- [Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078)  
Model2 :- [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)


Datasets used :- 

[AmbigQA](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/ambigqa/) :- An open domain question answering task that consists of predicting a set of question and answer pairs, where each plausible answer is associated with a disambiguated rewriting of the original question. 

[Break](https://allenai.github.io/Break/) :- Break is a set of data for understanding issues, aimed at training models to reason about complex issues. It consists of 83,978 natural language questions, annotated with a new meaning representation, the Question Decomposition Meaning Representation (QDMR). Each example includes the natural question and its QDMR representation.

[OpenOffice German - English dataset](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenOffice/v3/xml/de-en_GB.xml.gz) :- Collection of documents from [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/). The dataset contains text from Apache OpenOffice software in both German and English. The dataset contains 77,052 rows, and has been used to create a German - English translator using Model 1 and 2. 

[OpenSubtitles German - English Dataset](http://opus.nlpl.eu/download.php?f=OpenSubtitles/v2016/xml/de-en.xml.gz) :- Collection of subtitles from movies in both German and English obtained from [OpenSubtitles](http://www.opensubtitles.org/). The original dataset had approximately 13 million rows, 50000 of which have been used to create a German - English translator using Model 1 and 2.
